readium-lcp-client
==================

This repository is for the Readium Licensed Content Protection (LCP) client side implementation work.

Created by Artem Brazhnikov, MickaÃ«l Menu.
Maintained by Cyrille Lebeaupin, Daniel Weck.


## Overview

Cross-platform (iOS, Android and Windows) C++ decryption library for LCP protected documents.

 * Open and read metadata from a License Document.
 * Securely save User Keys on the device.
 * Handle License rights consumption (eg. Copy *n* characters).
 * Download a publication from a standalone LCPL file.
 * Implementation of a Content Filter compatible with Readium SDK to decrypt resources. With support for random access in media streams.
 
 
The library is a standalone solution and can be used without the Readium SDK. An optional Content Filter is available to add Readium compatiblity.


It is composed of several sub-projects:

* **LCP Client Library**, which is the standalone LCP C++ client library
* **LCP Content Filter**, an implementation of Readium SDK's Content Filter for LCP protected EPUB.
* **Obj-C bridge**, for the public API of LcpCryptoLib, to use on iOS and OS X.


## Getting Started

IDE projects are available for major supported platforms under `platform/`. Public headers to use in your application are put in `include/`.


### Building for iOS

The Xcode project for Apple platforms is located in `platform/apple/`. An iOS target is part of this project.

By default the target will build the library with Readium's Content Filter. You have to set the path to the SDK in `LCP Client.xcconfig` > `READIUM_PATH`. Or set `FEATURES_READIUM` to `0` to remove any dependency to Readium.


## Library API

This section summarizes the concept and main classes of the library. Please refer to the public headers in `include/` for the documentation of individual API.

### LCP Service

`C++: lcp::ILcpService, Obj-C: LCPService`

The LCP Service is the main gateway to the public API of the library. You must create an instance and initialize it with a LCP Root Certificate. Multiple instances with different configurations can live side-by-side.

The service is used to open a License from its JSON, acquire a new publication, decrypt content, add user keys and handle License rights consumption.


#### Providers

The LCP Service expects a number of Provider interface implementations at the initialization. These interfaces are here to make profit of specific platform tools, or remove dependency to third-party libraries (eg. cURL). For example, on iOS the implementation of `IStorageProvider` will use the iOS KeyChain to securely store rights consumption and User Keys. Also, the implementation of `INetProvider` will use `NSURLSession` instead of cURL.

The library offers a C++ cross-platform implementation of all providers, except for the `IStorageProvider`. If need to implement it your platform, make sure that data is securely stored.

* `IFileSystemProvider` for IO operations on the file system.
* `INetProvider` for HTTP network requests.
* `IStorageProvider` for *secure* persistence of library's data.
* `ICryptoProvider` for data decryption.


### License

`C++: lcp::ILicense, Obj-C: LCPLicense`

The License object represents a single License Document (LCPL file). It is passed around to almost every other API.

All the metadata contained in the License Document will be available through the License object, thanks to its accessors.

#### Encryption

A License instance can be in two states: *encrypted* or *decrypted*. If its User Key was already stored in the device, the LCP Service will decrypt the License automatically on opening. Otherwise, the License will be in the state *encrypted*. Some APIs (eg. for decrypting content) need a *decrypted* License to operate.

#### Shared Instances

The owner of the License instance is the LCP Service that created it. And the same License object will be returned for subsequent calls using the same canonical JSON.

You can take profit of that to have different components of your application using the same License object. For example, the Readium Content Filter will open a License using the shared LCP Service, but will not try to decrypt it since it doesn't have any way to prompt the User for the passphrase. It is the host app that should ask the user for his passphrase, if needed, and decrypt the shared License instance.

### Thread Safety
The library is thread-safe. The `IValueIterator`, `IReadableStream`, `IWritableStream` implementations are not thread-safe. They must be used only by one thread at a time.

### Ownership Strategy
All the methods with `Create` prefix implement the Factory Method pattern. The client of such methods takes ownership of the returned pointer. Other methods just use pointers owned by the `ILcpService` instance.

### Error Handling Strategy
The library returns the `Status` object to notify the client about LCP-specific errors. In other cases, when some error occurs inside of the library, STL exceptions can be thrown.
